I am from Huangshan, Anhui, and is currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Professor Fuchu He. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University. Currently, I am focusing on the fields of deep learning and bioinformatics, especially on decoding mass spectrometry-based    proteomic data.  

<h1>Research Interests</h1> 
Mass spectrometry data serve as both the starting point and the fundamental unit forproteomic data analysis. My research focuses on developing deep learning-basedanalytical     algorithms to explore mass spectrometry-based proteomic data from qualitativeand quantitative perspectives. These efforts include:<br>  
(1) Unsupervised representation learning methods to decode complex patterns in tandemmass spectra.<br>  
(2) Algorithms for de novo sequencing identification in tandem mass spectra.<br>  
(3) Algorithms designed to correct absolute protein quantification by predicting peptidebiases during enzymatic digestion, liquid chromatography and in a mass spectrometer.
